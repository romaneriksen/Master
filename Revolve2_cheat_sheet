# Create a robot body
- A modular robot follows a tree structure, with a "center core" as the parent node
```
body = BodyV2() # Creates the center core
```
- There are two different parts that one can attach to the core, a hinge and a brick, and these can also be attached to each other.
```
body.core_v2.left_face.bottom = ActiveHingeV2(RightAngles.DEG_0) # Attatches a hing to the core on the left?
body.core_v2.left_face.bottom = BrickV2(RightAngles.DEG_0) # Attatches a brick to the core on the left?
```
